MortelCross
===========

application which places a crosshair on the center of your screen.
Use F8 to quickly toggle visibility (previously alt+t; this was
changed because of JNativeHook having problems regestering the
correct number of keystrokes).

	- so far only supported by games with fullscreen windowed/borderless mode
